Hi Jeff,

The sample code got positive feedback from our developers, therefore we would like to proceed with further evaluations.
Please find below a programming test. 

Please get the details of programming test as enclosed, we'd like you to build a simple web application using the Google APIs. The specification is purposefully vague, but if there are any questions about what is expected, feel free to contact us.
The test is due in one week (by August 8th). You can submit the final source code in a zip file.

Goal
Create a web application to view a GMail user's calendar data, with the option to forward the calendar data in a mail message.

Process
The application operates as per the following:
1. The user uses his browser to navigate to the test application.
2. Authenticate the user via any Google authentication method, OAuth, AuthSub, ClientLogin, etc. (http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/GettingStarted.html) 
3. User the Google Calendar API to retrieve user calendar data. 
(https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/)
4. Retrieve the user's calendar data for the next two weeks and display it.
5. Allow the user to enter one or more e-mail addresses and click a button to open a GMail compose window prepopulated with the calendar data.

Notes
Please create your own GMail account for development.
The test application should be developed in Java and instructions on how to run or see the application working should be provided.

I was hoping to do a hangout interview but I am currently on a trip and the network connection is not enough for video chat. We will do that after I got back to the States next week.
